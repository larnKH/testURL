Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford (pictured), Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos. It depicts a dystopian world in 2019, where genetically engineered humanoid replicants are used for dangerous work on off-world colonies. Four of them have illegally come to Los Angeles to confront the man who designed them. They are hunted by Rick Deckard (Ford), who is troubled by his relationship with Rachael, an advanced replicant. The film, a loose adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. It polarized critics and underperformed in theaters, but won many awards and has since become a cult film. It was one of the first films released on DVD. Hailed for its tech noir production design, it was inducted into the National Film Registry in 1993, and is now highly regarded by many critics. In 2007 Warner Bros. released a remastered version. A sequel, Blade Runner 2049, is set for release in October 2017.
